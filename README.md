# Netrunner: A Scanner written in Nim :telescope: :sailboat:

Netrunner is my personal foray into making a portscanner that can handle UDP, TCP Connect and SYN scans, based on the three most popular types in Nmap. It uses multithreading for a quicker parsing of the results, and is generally reliable.

Thank you for reading!

## A note

Right now it only has an interactive prompt, so it's fairly easy to use. 

Down the road I intend to release a second version of it that passes instructions by CLI and is async instead of using pure multithreading.

### Bugs

Let me know if there are any. I'm eager to learn.
